## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd MakeFirstPR
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b username
```

For example:

```
git checkout -b aryasoni98
```

(The name of the branch does not need to have the word _add_ in it, but it's a reasonable thing to include because the purpose of this branch is to add your name to a list.)

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add file-name
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Add <file-name>"
```

replacing `<file-name>` with your name.

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```

replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.


## Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.
