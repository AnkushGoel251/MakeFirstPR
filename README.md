## First Contributions


This project aims to simplify and guide the way beginners make their first contribution. If you are looking to make your first contribution, follow the steps below.

#### If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

## Fork this repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="#" alt="fork this repository" />

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="#" alt="clone this repository" />

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

<img align="right" width="300" src="#" alt="copy URL to clipboard" />

```
git clone git@github.com:CodeTrophs/MakeFirstPR.git
```

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd MakeFirstPR
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b username
```

For example:

```
git checkout -b aryasoni98
```

(The name of the branch does not need to have the word _add_ in it, but it's a reasonable thing to include because the purpose of this branch is to add your name to a list.)
